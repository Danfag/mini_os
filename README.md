This is a project that I worked on as I was learning about Operating Systems to get a stronger understanding of the material.

This emulation implements Unix-like Command Line Interfacing, process creation/management, scheduling(FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Aging), memory management(virtual memory, demand paging) at a high level.

There is still a lot of optimization work that can be done, and a lot of features that can be added(a file system, system calls, multi-level page tables etc.)

I am open to any advice and/or criticizing, this stuff is really fascinating and learning is my ultimate goal :)
